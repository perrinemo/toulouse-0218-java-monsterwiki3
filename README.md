# MonsterLegendsWiki

### What is MonsterLegendsWiki
Development of a first Android application.

The application is an adaptation of the wiki of the game Monster Legends.

The application opens on a splash-screen, then on a grid of monsters.
By clicking on a monster, we access the specific view of the monster.
By scrolling on the side, we can see the different evolutions of the monster.

An easter-egg is hidden behind the banner of the homepage.
